## "DaisyUI is about styling + components, not advanced animations."
## DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS plugin.
## It mainly gives you pre-styled UI components (buttons, cards, modals, navbar, etc.).
## Itâ€™s like a design system built on Tailwind.

 - ðŸ”¹ React-Bit (or other animation libraries)

- React animation libraries (Framer Motion, React Spring, GSAP, etc.) are separate from DaisyUI.

- They only handle animations/transitions, not styling.

## ðŸ”¹ Why React?
- Component-based architecture  
- Fast rendering with Virtual DOM  
- Reusable UI components  
- Strong community support  
- Works with modern tools (Webpack, Babel, Vite etc.)

## ðŸ”¹ Installation
